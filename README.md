# Hello-World

You can call me Bernie.  I'm on a learning journey.  I've recently learned about MySQL, PHP, and Joomla.  Although I've created and administered a Joomla! website for about 5 years, I've never created a component.
And seeing that Joomla!4 is out, I'm starting with a fresh copy as a test platform.
I've successfully followed the available tutorial for creating an MVC component called HelloWorld, at least up to the point where the database is created and installed with Greetings table
Since the tuturials ceased at this point, it looks as though I'm on my own to incorporate those table values into my component.  
Will tutorials for Joomla 3.x be sufficient to figure out what I need to add next?
I think I'll find a free extension that I can reverse engineer to see what comes next.  
What would be an ideal extension to consider?  Something that creates a backend component menu, and a database table.
